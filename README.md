# Java-Space-Invaders-Emulator
A Space Invaders 8080 emulator writen in Java based on [emulator101](http://emulator101.com/)

It can actually display the content of the Space Invaders game, but input doesn't work.

The project needs an invaders/ folder next to this README.md with the binary game inside to work. See the [emulator101](http://emulator101.com/) page for more information.
